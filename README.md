# Churn Risk Prediction Some Company

Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in Deep Learning to forecast whether customers will churn or not based on historical customer data. This will help the company identify and address potential churn customers more effectively, thereby allowing the company to retain more customers.

Project Output:

The output of this project is a churn prediction model that can be used to predict whether a customer will churn or not. Additionally, the analysis results of the model will be presented in the form of a report that includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics of the model.

Brief Explanation of the Data Used:

The dataset contains information about company customers with attributes such as user_id, age, gender, region_category, membership_category, joining_date, joined_through_referral, preferred_offer_types, and other relevant attributes. This historical data is used for churn risk prediction.

Method Used:

The method employed in this project is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a Machine Learning model in Deep Learning. ANN is a type of artificial neural network capable of recognizing complex patterns in data and making predictions based on those patterns. The process of training ANN involves modeling the network structure, setting parameters, and optimizing the model.

Project Advantages:

    The use of ANN in Deep Learning allows the model to capture complex patterns in data that might be difficult for conventional models to recognize.
    Churn prediction will help the company reduce customer churn and develop more effective marketing strategies.

Project Limitations:

    Historical customer data may be limited and might not encompass recent situations, which could affect the prediction accuracy for new customers or different scenarios.
    Depending on the amount of data and model complexity, training ANN might require significant computational resources.
